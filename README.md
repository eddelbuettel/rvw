## rvw

R interface to [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)


### What is Vowpal Wabbit?

[Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) is a fast
on-line learner built by [John Langford](http://hunch.net/~jl/) and others,
initially at Yahoo! Research and now at Microsoft Research


### What does _rvw_ do?

This _rvw_ package builds upon the
[skeleton r.vw package](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/tree/master/R/r.vw)
in the [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)
sources. It has streamlined the packaging and added a few things here and
there.


### Requirements

You will need the `vw` binary in your path.  On Debian / Ubuntu systems to

```sh
sudo apt-get install vowpal-wabbiit
```

On other systems follow the
[Vowpal Wabbit instructions](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/blob/master/README.md).


### Status

Still being worked on.


### What about [RVowpalWabbit](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rvowpalwabbit) ?

I will get to [RVowpalWabbit](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rvowpalwabbit)
which is now much easier given that a)
[Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) itself
now sports a sane build system and b) distributions contain a library for
it. Consider _rvw_ as a stepping stone.
